# 3D models

Printable parts and source CAD for the Tiny Engineer desk robot.

## Source CAD (edit / resize)

The full assembly — all components composed — lives in [`cad/TinyEngineer.f3d`](cad/TinyEngineer.f3d) (Autodesk Fusion). Open that file to adjust the model or adapt it to different hardware sizing (e.g. different servos).

## Printables

Individual parts are exported to [`parts/`](parts/) as `.3mf` files. They are ready to print in an orientation that does not need supports. Print with **PLA** or **PETG**.

Assembly uses a bunch of **2 mm diameter screws** — no glue. Easy to dismount and modify later. Exact screw lengths/counts and full assembly steps are **not documented yet**. Use the part table below, then electrical and bring-up docs.
