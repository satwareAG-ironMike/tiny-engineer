# Integrating Tiny Engineer

Tiny Engineer is a Wi-Fi desk robot. Drive it from any tool that can make HTTP requests, or use the Cursor-specific helper that maps agent hook events to poses.

Robot must be on the same network. Base URL: `http://tiny-engineer.local` (or the IP shown on the OLED). Full HTTP reference: [`api.md`](api.md).

Two integration paths:

| Path | Best for | How |
|---|---|---|
| **REST API** | Any AI IDE, script, CI, custom agent | `POST /anim?name=…` |
| **Cursor CLI** | Cursor project hooks | `npx` → `tiny-engineer-cursor` |

  end

```

## 1. REST API (any AI IDE)

Call the board directly. Works with Claude Code, Windsurf, Continue, custom plugins, shell hooks, or anything that can `POST` over HTTP.

### Main call

```bash
curl -X POST "http://tiny-engineer.local/anim?name=typing"
```

| `name` | Typical use |
|---|---|
| `typing` | Agent writing / editing / running tools |
| `reading` | Agent reading files / context |
| `thinking` | Agent reasoning / waiting on a long step |
| `ring` | Turn finished (attention ping) |
| `welcome` | Session start / greeting |
| `wakeup` | Sleep-inertia wake (eyes/head) |
| `sleep` | Force sleep (eye close + OLED off) |
| `attention` | Needs user input |
| `error` / `abort` | Failure / cancel |
| `dead` | Out of power (error line, then X X hold) |
| `none` | Idle / clear pose |

Firmware holds each pose ≥1s and keeps only the **latest** pending switch — spam-safe. Auth is optional: if you set an access token on the device, send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (check `GET /auth` for `required`). Prefer short timeouts (e.g. 2s) and ignore network errors so the agent never stalls if the robot is offline.

### Minimal examples

**Shell**

```bash
curl -4 -sS -m 2 -X POST "http://tiny-engineer.local/anim?name=reading" >/dev/null || true
```

**JavaScript (Node 18+)**

```js
await fetch("http://tiny-engineer.local/anim?name=thinking", {
  method: "POST",
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(2000),
}).catch(() => {});
```

**Python**

```python
import urllib.request
urllib.request.urlopen(
    urllib.request.Request(
        "http://tiny-engineer.local/anim?name=typing",
        method="POST",
    ),
    timeout=2,
)
```

Wire these into your IDE’s hook / plugin / lifecycle events (prompt submitted → `reading`, tool use → `typing`, turn end → `ring`, etc.). Mapping is yours; the robot only cares about `name`.

Health check (no motion):

```bash
curl http://tiny-engineer.local/health
```

More routes (tests, servo, web UI): [`api.md`](api.md).

## 2. Cursor dedicated script

For [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) only: a small Node CLI reads Cursor hook JSON on stdin, picks an animation, and POSTs `/anim`. No need to implement the event map yourself.

### Command

```bash
npx -y --package=https://github.com/jamro/tiny-engineer/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz tiny-engineer-cursor
```

- HTTPS **tarball** (not `github:…` SSH shorthand — that often fails in Cursor hooks with no SSH agent).
- Bin name `tiny-engineer-cursor` required after `--package=…`.
- Optional: `--url http://192.168.x.x` (default `http://tiny-engineer.local`).
- Auth: if the device has an `access_token`, set `TINY_ENGINEER_TOKEN` in the process env or a project-root `.env` file (same value). The CLI sends `Authorization: Bearer …`. No token → no header (auth disabled on device).
- `--help` for usage and event map.

### Smoke test

```bash
npx -y --package=https://github.com/jamro/tiny-engineer/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz tiny-engineer-cursor --help
echo '{"hook_event_name":"stop"}' | npx -y --package=https://github.com/jamro/tiny-engineer/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz tiny-engineer-cursor
```

### Wire into any Cursor project

In that project’s `.cursor/hooks.json`, use the same command for each anim hook. Set **`timeout` ≥ 30** (cold `npx` can exceed 2s). Full sample + event table: [`hooks.md`](hooks.md).

Inside this firmware repo you can instead run the local bin while developing the CLI:

```bash
node packages/tiny-engineer-cursor/bin/tiny-engineer-cursor.js
```

## Which to choose?

- **Building for one IDE / custom agent** → REST. One `POST`, zero Node dependency.
- **Using Cursor and want zero mapping code** → Cursor CLI + hooks.
- **Both** are fine together: CLI is just a thin client of the same `/anim` API.

Prerequisites for either path: flash firmware, join 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, confirm `http://tiny-engineer.local/health` (or the OLED IP) responds.
